    I want it to be, like, messy
    I'm so insecure, I think
    That I'll die before I drink
    And I'm so caught up in the news
    Of who likes me and who hates you
    And I'm so tired that I might
    Quit my job, start a new life
    And they'd all be so disappointed
    'Cause, who am I, if not exploited?
    And I'm so sick of 17
    I'm over this teenage dream?
    If someone tells me one more time
    Enjoy your youth, I'm gonna cry
    And I don't stick up for myself
    I'm anxious and nothing can help
    And I wish I'd done this before
    And I wish people liked me more
    All I did was try my best
    This the kind of thanks I get?
    Unrelentlessly upset (ah, ah, ah)
    They say these are the golden years
    But I wish I could disappear
    Ego crush is so severe
    God, it's brutal out here
    I feel like no one wants me
    And I hate the way I'm perceived
    I only have two real friends
    And lately, I'm a nervous wreck
    'Cause I love people I don't like
    And I hate every song I write
    And I'm not cool and I'm not smart
    And I can't even parallel park
    All I did was try my best
    This the kind of thanks I get?
    Unrelentlessly upset (ah, ah, ah)
    They say these are the golden years
    But I wish I could disappear
    Ego crush is so severe
    God, it's brutal out here
    Got a broken ego, broken heart

    It took you two weeks to go off and date her
    Guess you didn't cheat, but you're still a traitor
    Now you bring her around just to shut me down
    Show her off like she's a new trophy

    Could fall in love with somebody that quickly

    It's back and forth, maybe this is all your fault instead
